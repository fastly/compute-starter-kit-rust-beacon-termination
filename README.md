# Compute@Edge starter kit for beacon termination

Capture beacon data from the browser, divert beacon request payloads to a log endpoint, and avoid putting load on your own infrastructure.

**For more details about this and other starter kits for Compute@Edge, see the [Fastly Developer Hub](https://developer.fastly.com/solutions/starters/)**.

## What are beacons?

Beacons are HTTP requests, usually `POST`s, sent from a web browser to record some analytics data. Browsers offer native support for beacons via the `navigator.sendBeacon` method, and via the [Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/09/reportingapi) for out-of-band reports on browser-generated warnings like CSP and feature policy violations, deprecations, browser interventions, and network errors. Native apps will also often send beacon data back to base.

**For an in-depth guide to beacon termination using VCL, see the [Beacon Termination tutorial](https://developer.fastly.com/solutions/tutorials/beacon-termination/)**.

## Features

- Exposes a `POST /reports` endpoint to receive beacon reports (in batches)
- Deserializes individual reports from JSON to Rust data structures, with optional type-checking (see [Payload examples](#payload-examples))
- Enriches the data with information available at the edge, e.g. by adding geo data
- Sends reports to a logging endpoint as individual JSON lines
  N.B.: Depending on which [logging endpoint type](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/logging/) is chosen, these lines may be batched.
- Responds with a synthetic 204

### Payload examples

This starter kit allows an individual report to be any valid JSON value.

For optional type-checking, it also includes the data structures for some common report payloads. These structures can be imported from modules following the `example_...` naming convention:

- CSP Violations
  ```
  mod example_csp_violation;
  use crate::example_csp_violation::ReportBody;
  ```
- Network Errors
  ```
  mod example_network_error_log;
  use crate::example_network_error_log::ReportBody;
  ```
- Core Web Vitals
  ```
  mod example_core_web_vital;
  use crate::example_core_web_vital::ReportBody;
  ```
  Tip: Use the [web-vitals JavaScript library](https://web.dev/vitals/) to measure all the Core Web Vitals.

## Requirements

The following resources need to exist on your active Fastly service version for this starter kit to work:

- A [logging endpoint](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/about-fastlys-realtime-log-streaming-features) called `reports`.
